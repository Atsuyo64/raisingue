2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.092 ns between u_diex/OUTC_reg[2]_replica/C (clocked by sysclk_pin) and u_exmem/OUTB_reg[2]/D (clocked by sysclk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.042 ns between u_diex/OUTC_reg[2]_replica/C (clocked by sysclk_pin) and u_exmem/OUTB_reg[1]/D (clocked by sysclk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.913 ns between u_diex/OUTC_reg[2]_replica/C (clocked by sysclk_pin) and u_exmem/OUTB_reg[0]/D (clocked by sysclk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on RST relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysclk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PC_out[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysclk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PC_out[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysclk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PC_out[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysclk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PC_out[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysclk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PC_out[4] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysclk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PC_out[5] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysclk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PC_out[6] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysclk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PC_out[7] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysclk_pin.
Related violations: <none>
